## Installation

You can install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install topsis_vardhan_102203268
```

## Usage

### Input File Format

The input CSV file should have the following structure:

- The first column should contain the names of the models.
- The subsequent columns should contain the criteria values for each alternative.
- The first row should contain the headers for each column.

Example:

| model | Criteria 1 | Criteria 2 | Criteria 3 |
|-------------|------------|------------|------------|
| m1        | 250        | 16         | 12         |
| m2        | 200        | 14         | 8          |
| m3        | 300        | 18         | 15         |

### Command-line Usage

After installation, you can use the `topsis` command in the terminal:

```bash
topsis <input_file> <weights> <impacts> <output_file>
```

- `<input_file>`: Path to the input CSV file.
- `<weights>`: Comma-separated string of weights for the criteria.
- `<impacts>`: Comma-separated string of '+' or '-' indicating the desirability of the criteria.
- `<output_file>`: Path to the output CSV file to save the results.

## TOPSIS Method Explained

TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) is a multi-criteria decision-making method. The basic concept is to find the alternative that is closest to the ideal solution and farthest from the nadir solution. The ideal solution maximizes the benefit criteria and minimizes the cost criteria, while the nadir solution does the opposite.

## Example

```bash
topsis data.csv "0.5,0.3,0.2" "+,-,+" results.csv
```

This command will process the `data.csv` file using the specified weights and impacts and output the results to `results.csv`.

## NOTE

- Ensure that the input file has at least three columns: one for alternatives and at least two for criteria.
- All criteria columns should contain numeric values.
- The number of weights and impacts must match the number of criteria.
- Impacts should only be '+' or '-'.
